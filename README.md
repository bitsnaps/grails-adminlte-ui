adminlte-ui: a Grails plugin for installing the AdminLTE template
=================================================================

_adminlte-ui_ is a plugin based on two existing and *awesome* projects:

* [AdminLTE](http://almsaeedstudio.com/preview) Dashboard and Control Panel Template authored by [Abdullah Almsaeed](https://twitter.com/Almasaeed2010) from [Almsaeed Studio](http://almsaeedstudio.com).
* The Navigation API of the [Grails Platform Core](http://grails.org/plugin/platform-core) plugin.

The goal is to provide a nice UI theme to Grails applications reusing these projects in a way that is as easy and functional as possible.

Also, some ideas for the implementation have been taken from the [Kickstart with Bootstrap](https://grails.org/plugin/kickstart-with-bootstrap) Grails plugin.

Thanks a lot to all the developers of these mentioned projects! They have done an excellent and very valuable work.

Right now _adminlte-ui_ offers a minimal and very basic functionality.
