_adminlte-ui_ is a plugin based on two existing and *awesome* projects:

* "AdminLTE":http://almsaeedstudio.com/preview Dashboard and Control Panel Template authored by "Abdullah Almsaeed":https://twitter.com/Almasaeed2010 from "Almsaeed Studio":http://almsaeedstudio.com.
* The Navigation API of the "Grails Platform Core":http://grails.org/plugin/platform-core plugin.

The goal is to provide a nice UI theme to Grails applications reusing these projects in a way that is as easy and functional as possible.

Also, some ideas for the implementation have been taken from the "Kickstart with Bootstrap":https://grails.org/plugin/kickstart-with-bootstrap Grails plugin.

Thanks a lot to all the developers of these mentioned projects! They have done an excellent and very valuable work.

Right now _adminlte-ui_ offers a minimal and very basic functionality.
